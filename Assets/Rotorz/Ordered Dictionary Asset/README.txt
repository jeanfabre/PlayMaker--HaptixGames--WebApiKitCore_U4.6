https://bitbucket.org/rotorz/reorderable-list-editor-field-for-unity

Installing scripts
------------------

This control can be added to your project by importing the Unity package which
contains a compiled class library (DLL). This can be used by C# and UnityScript
developers. Minimal version of package does not include demonstration assets or
zip archive of image source resources.

- [Download RotorzOrderedDictionaryAsset_v0.1.0 Package (requires Unity 4.5.5+)](<https://bitbucket.org/rotorz/ordered-dictionary-asset-for-unity/downloads/RotorzOrderedDictionaryAsset_v0.1.0.unitypackage>)

If you would prefer to use the non-compiled source code version in your project,
copy the contents of this repository somewhere into your project.

**Note to UnityScript (*.js) developers:**

UnityScript will not work with the source code version of this project unless
the contents of this repository is placed at the path "Assets/Plugins/OrderedDictionaryAsset"
due to compilation ordering.

Example 1: Sprite Library (C#)
------------------------------

    :::csharp
    // SpriteLibrary.cs
    using Rotorz.Extras.Collections;
	using UnityEditor;
    using UnityEngine;

	// Note: The `CreateAssetMenu` attribute requires Unity 5+

	[CreateAssetMenu]
    public class SpriteLibrary : OrderedDictionaryAsset<string, Sprite> {
    }

Submission to the Unity Asset Store
-----------------------------------

If you wish to include this asset as part of a package for the asset store, please
include the latest package version as-is to avoid conflict issues in user projects.
It is important that license and documentation files are included and remain intact.

**To include a modified version within your package:**

- Ensure that license and documentation files are included and remain intact. It should
  be clear that these relate to the ordered dictionary asset library.

- Copyright and license information must remain intact in source files.

- Change the namespace `Rotorz` to something unique and DO NOT use the
  name "Rotorz". For example, `YourName.Collections` or `YourName.Internal.Collections`.

- Place files somewhere within your own asset folder to avoid causing conflicts with
  other assets which make use of this project.
